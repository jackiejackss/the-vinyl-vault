# The Vinyl Vault 🎵💿
A personal collection, given to me by my Dad, of vinyl records displayed on a website. 
I am also doing this to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of learning I am doing outside of my full-time job.

## Features
- View a searchable table of vinyl records
- Browse by artist, genre, or release year
- Learn the stories behind the music

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Explore the records collection.
3. More features coming soon!

## Future Plans 🚀
- Add a "Record of the Day" feature
- Implement a JSON-based dynamic display
- Host it on GitHub Pages
